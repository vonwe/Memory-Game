## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used, YouTube and w3schools.com to complete this.  The Youtube channels I used specifically were, "Bro Code", and "WEB Programming".

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
My main challenge was getting the html file to properly call the javascript functions.  I was able to overcome this by placing all the associated files in the same folder.  I also had to refer back to W3schools a few times to be sure I was calling my Javascript functions correctly.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Would there be anyway to efficiently perform functions, set up a layout, and stylize  the page while only utilizing one file type?
How many pre-built functions does javascript have?  Are more added? If so, by whom?
What innovations would it take to render HTML5 obsolete?  Are there any attempts at an HTML6?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
With more hours, I would have the project working at full capacity.  Jokes aside, it would be satisfying to implement more buttons, more rounds, and a penalty sound as well.  A special animation that plays upon winning the game would also be implemented if I had more time to dedicate to it.
